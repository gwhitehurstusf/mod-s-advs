Question A: Represents number of ice cream purchases during the academic year for each of the five housmates: 8,14,16,10,11
a) compute the mean for this: 
mean(x)
[1] 11.8
b) select a random sampling of size 2 out of 5 members:
> sample(2:14,5)
[1] 10  2  8 12  9
c) compute the mean and standard deviation of your sample:
> mean(sample)
[1] 3.5
> sd(sample)
[1] 1.290994
> sd(x)
[1] 3.193744
d) compare the mean and standard deviation of your sample to the entire population of this set (x): mean(x) and sd(x) have larger values, therefore the entire population(x) will produce
more ice cream in a five housemates data frame, then the sample, although the sample(s) has a greater chance at being more closely valued with the sd being smaller.  

Question B: Suppose that the sample size n=100 and the population proportion p=0.95. 
a) Does the sample proportion have appoximately a normal distribution? Explain. 
Calculating the z-score: with alpha at 0.05:
FORMULA:::::
xbar= 11.8 ## sample mean
m0=(x) ## hypothesized value
sigma=3.193744 ## population standard deviation
n=100 ## sample size
z= (xbar-m0)/(sigma/sqrt(n))
z ## test statistic

alpha=0.05
z.alpha=qnorm(1-alpha)
z.alpha ##critical value

PROBLEM VALUE::::
xbar= 11.8 ## sample mean
> m0=(x) ## hypothesized value
> sigma=3.193744 ## population standard deviation
> n=100 ## sample size
> z= (xbar-m0)/(sigma/sqrt(n))
> z ## test statistic
[1]  11.898261  -6.888467 -13.150710   5.636018   2.504897
> alpha=0.05
> z.alpha=qnorm(1-alpha)
> z.alpha ##critical value
[1] 1.644854

on the table, the z-score is 0.95053, 
I would say yes, that the normal distribution is consistent with the probability. I'm going to try and add a graph to see the distribution in the section below. 

b) What is the smallest value of n for which the sampling distribution of p is approximately normal? 
For both sets of data, the answer is 1. 
pnorm(100, mean=11.8, sd=3.193744)
[1] 1
> pnorm(100, mean=3.5, sd=1.290994)
[1] 1

Question C: Simulated coin tossing is probability better done using functional -rbinom than using function sample. Explain. 
Ex: Toss a coin 10 times: rbinom(10, 1, 0.5), it's going to give you a set of data at random of what could happen for the tossing between heads or tails. And if you use this, it can be 
useful for having a projection of real, probable results that can be forecasting of a live event. With sample, the data is just a set of numbers, a sample, of the data. It's not as broad
as rbinom.
